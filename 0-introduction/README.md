# Introduction to Programming
Welcome to the exciting world of programming! A few things to cover first becore we start writing some code.

1. Understand the lingo. There are different new words such as IDE or JIT, CLI, UI, etc. It's ok to not know these yet, just have patience and learn as you go. 
2. Every programming language expects codes to be written (or some times spoken to). You are going to need an editor. While there are many options out there, this tutorial will use VS Code.
3. Write your logic on paper first. We call this pseudocode. Trust, you'll appreciate this in the long term. Whiteboards are excellent for this exercise.
4. Learn to establish goals. Don't try to write everything at once. Define a plan (steps) and learn to execute it. Sometimes, we refer to this as an algorithm.
